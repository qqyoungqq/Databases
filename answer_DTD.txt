/*------ XML Data DTD Exercises--------*/
--Q1. In this question, you are to create a DTD for a small XML data set drawn from the Stanford course catalog. There are multiple departments, each with a department chair, some courses, and professors and/or lecturers who teach courses. The XML data is 
https://prod-c2g.s3.amazonaws.com/db/Winter2013/files/courses-noID.xml. 

<!ELEMENT Course_Catalog (Department*)>
<!ELEMENT Department (Title, Chair, Course+)>
<!ATTLIST Department Code CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ELEMENT Title (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Chair (Professor)>
<!ELEMENT Professor (First_Name, Middle_Initial?, Last_Name)>
<!ELEMENT Course (Title, Description?, Instructors, Prerequisites?)>
<!ATTLIST Course Number CDATA #REQUIRED Enrollment CDATA #IMPLIED>
<!ELEMENT Description (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Instructors (Lecturer | Professor)* >
<!ELEMENT Lecturer (First_Name, Middle_Initial?, Last_Name)>
<!ELEMENT First_Name (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Middle_Initial (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Last_Name (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Prerequisites (Prereq+)>
<!ELEMENT Prereq (#PCDATA)>

--Q2. In this question, you are to create a DTD for a different version of the data set drawn from the Stanford course catalog. This version encodes the data using ID and IDREF(S) attributes. The XML data is https://prod-c2g.s3.amazonaws.com/db/Winter2013/files/courses-ID.xml. 

<!ELEMENT Course_Catalog (Department*)>
<!ELEMENT Department (Title, Course+,(Lecturer | Professor)*)>
<!ATTLIST Department Code CDATA #REQUIRED Chair IDREF #REQUIRED>
<!ELEMENT Title (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Course (Title, Description?)>
<!ATTLIST Course Number ID #REQUIRED
                 Prerequisites CDATA #IMPLIED
                 Instructors CDATA #REQUIRED
                 Enrollment CDATA #IMPLIED>
<!ELEMENT Description (#PCDATA | Courseref)*> 
<!ELEMENT Courseref EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST Courseref Number IDREF #REQUIRED>
<!ELEMENT Professor (First_Name, Middle_Initial?, Last_Name)>
<!ATTLIST Professor InstrID ID #REQUIRED>
<!ELEMENT Lecturer (First_Name, Middle_Initial?, Last_Name)>
<!ATTLIST Lecturer InstrID ID #REQUIRED>
<!ELEMENT First_Name (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Middle_Initial (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Last_Name (#PCDATA)>

--Q3. In this question, you are to create a DTD for a small XML data set about world countries. This data is adapted from the Mondial 3.0 database as hosted by the University of Washington, and was originally compiled by the Georg-August University of Goettingen Institute for Informatics. Each country has a name, population, and area (in sq. km). Some countries also list languages (with percentages of the population that speaks each language) and/or cities (with names and populations). The XML data is https://prod-c2g.s3.amazonaws.com/db/Winter2013/files/countries.xml. 

<!ELEMENT countries (country*)>
<!ELEMENT country (language | city)*>
<!ATTLIST country name CDATA #REQUIRED 
                  population CDATA #REQUIRED 
                  area CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ELEMENT language (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST language percentage CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ELEMENT city (name, population)>
<!ELEMENT name (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT population (#PCDATA)>
